# Mutation check for the lines a change touches in the shipped scripts.
#
# The coverage gate (tests/check-coverage.sh) proves a line *ran* under the
# suite. It cannot tell whether any test would notice that line being wrong:
# a branch can run in every test and still have no assertion that depends on
# it. This script asks that second question, for changed lines only.
#
# For each line that differs from the base revision in a file
# .coverage-thresholds.json gates, it writes one small edit at a time into a
# copy of the checkout -- a comparison flipped, `&&` swapped for `||`, an exit
# status changed, the line replaced by `:` -- and runs the test files that name
# that script. A test file failing (or timing out) means the edit was caught.
# An edit no test catches is a survivor, and the run fails unless that exact
# edit is listed in tests/mutation-survivors.txt with the reason it changes
# nothing a test could observe.
#
# Edits that `bash -n` rejects are dropped before anything runs: they say
# nothing about the tests.
#
# Which test files run for which script is the TESTS_FOR table below, not a
# search: tests/test-gate-git-diff.sh quotes most script paths in its corpus and
# takes minutes, and running it for every edit would spend the budget on a file
# that tests the hook, not the script. A changed script with no row stops the
# run, so a new script cannot be skipped silently.
#
# Before any edit, the script's own test files run once on the unedited copy.
# If they fail there, every edit would look caught, so the run stops instead.
#
# .claude/hooks/gate-git-diff.sh is left out. tests/test-gate-git-diff.sh
# already mutation-tests each of its rules, and one run of that file takes
# minutes, so a hook change would spend the whole budget below on it.
#
# Usage: tests/mutation-check.sh [BASE_REF]   (default: origin/main)
#   MUTATION_TIMEOUT  seconds one test file may run before the edit counts as
#                     caught (default 300)
#   MUTATION_BUDGET   seconds for the whole run; edits left when it runs out
#                     are reported and the run fails (default 2400)
#
# Exit status: 0 every edit was caught or is listed, 1 an unlisted survivor,
# 2 the check could not run or ran out of budget.
